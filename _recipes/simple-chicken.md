tags: chicken, main

ingredients:
- chicken breasts
- lemon (1 or 2, depends how much chicken)
- olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1⁄4 teaspoon pepper

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 425° or so
- If the chicken's very thick, either smash it down or slice it in half
- Pat the chicken dry with some paper towels
- Put the chicken in a casserole dish or some other pan
- Pour a little bit of olive oil over the chicken, and roll the chicken around in it so it's covered
- Mix up the spices in a little bowl -- increase the amounts based on the amount of chicken, just keep those (rough) ratios
- Put the spices on the chicken -- spread it evenly, and make sure to get both sides
- Slice the lemon and arrange the slices on the chicken
- Put in the oven and bake uncovered for 15-20 minutes (or maybe longer if it's thick)
- Let it rest for a few minutes after it finishes cooking
- Serve with something easy (roasted veggies? Spanish rice? Etc)
